# Instructions

This directory holds guides for various tools / environments that will be used throughout the course. They may make most sense to read in the order they are numbered, but also hold some cross-references to each other.

### 1 - Environment setup

Here you will find instructions on how to setup the environment that will be used during the course. The instructions here apply to both your local computer and the cloud virtual machine that will be used in the later stages.

### 2 - Google cloud instructions

In this course you will utilize a virtual machine in Google cloud for HA1, HA2 and the project.  
Note that we _strongly_  recommend that you setup this machine as early as possible to make sure that everything works, preferably before HA1 is released.

### 3 - Using Jupyter notebooks on cloud

Here you can find the steps needed to ensure that your Jupyter notebooks that you work with locally also work in the cloud.

### 4 - Keep git repo in sync

During the course, the GitHub repository is expected to be updated many times, for various reasons, e.g.
- Updating instructions
- Posting new assignments
- Updating already released assignments (we will do our best to avoid it, but at times it may be necessary for us to do this)

Here you can find instructions on how to best keep in sync with the latest update and what to do if you encounter any problems.
