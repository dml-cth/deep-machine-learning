    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOR HA1, HA2, HA3 ONLY:** Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of POEs (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use Google Cloud's GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

    "We will use both deterministic and stochastic transition/dynamics models for the white states. When the transition model is deterministic, taking an action $a$ (e.g., Up) takes the agent in the intended direction (e.g., Up) with probability 1. When the transition model is stochastic, taking an action $a$ takes the agent in the intended direction with probability $p$, and with probability $1-p$, the agent goes in a different direction depending on the specification of the stochastic transition model.\n",

Strictly speaking, we never take any actions in a terminal state, but in our visualizations we assume the default action Up for these states, which is an arbitrary choice. "

    "## Section 4: Deep Q-learning \n",
    "In this section, you will implement a deep Q-learning network (DQN) to solve one of the problems of the OpenAI gym. Before we get to the implementation, let's first review DQN theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the video lectures, using a neural network as a state action value approximator is a great idea. However, if one tries to use this approach with Q-learning, it's very likely that the optimization will be very unstable. To remediate this, two main ideas are used.\n",
    "- First, we use experience replay, in order to decorrelate the experience samples we obtain when exploring the environment.\n",
    "- Second, we use two networks instead of one, in order to fix the optimization targets. Each of these ideas are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Experience replay\n",
    "Since Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm, we may collect data by navigating in the environment using some choice of behavioral / exploratory policy $\\mu$ (e.g. $\\epsilon$-greedy), while still learning the $\\hat{q}$ values for an optimal policy. Experience replay exploits this even further, and re-uses old data, which was collected using whatever exploratory policy we used at that moment (e.g. $\\epsilon$-greedy w.r.t. to that data approximate $\\hat{q}$ values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for re-using already collected data, another advantage of experience replay is that it allows us to decorrelate the data, by sampling experience from very different parts of the environment, rather than using the samples for training in the order they were collected when walking around in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorrelating the data is essential for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Fixing the optimization target\n",
    "That is, for a given minibatch sampled from the replay buffer, we'll optimize the weights of only one of the networks (commonly denoted as the \"online\" network), using the gradients w.r.t a loss function. This loss function is computed as the mean squared error between the current action values, computed according to the **online** network, and the Q targets, computed using the other, **offline network** (which we'll also refer to as the fixed network or target network).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the loss function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(\\hat{q}(s_i,a_i; \\theta\\right) - y_i)^2~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of samples in your minibatch, $\\hat{q}(s,a;\\theta)$ is the state action value estimate, according to the online network (with parameters $\\theta$), and $y_t$ is the Q target, computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = r_i +  \\gamma ~\\underset{a}{\\text{max}}~\\hat{q}(s_i', a; \\theta^-)~, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{q}(s', a;\\theta')$ is the action value estimate, according to the offline network (with parameters $\\theta^-$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, so that the offline parameters are also updated, we periodically copy the parameters from the online to the offline network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Training loop essentials\n",
    "The following key components are repeated for every time step $t$ in an episode:\n",
    "1. Sample an action $a_t$ from the $\\epsilon$-greedy policy w.r.t. the current estimated $\\hat{q}$ values (online network), and execute the action in the environment.\n",
    "1. The current transition $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ is stored in the replay buffer.\n",
    "1. An entire mini-batch of transitions is sampled from the replay buffer, and a gradient step is taken to improve the online network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Target notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different optimization targets which are estimated with some $q$ function are often jointly referred to as \"TD targets\".\n",
    "We strive to be consistent and separate on-policy \"TD(0) targets\" and off-policy \"Q targets\" but in other places this distinction may be less clear."
