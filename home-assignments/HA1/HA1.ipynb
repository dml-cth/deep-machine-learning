    "### Checklist for submission\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOR HA1, HA2 ONLY:** Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to a request for resubmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this. Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

    "### 1.1 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To create data loaders we first need to create a dataset abstraction class. The purpose of a data loader is to efficiently provide the CPU/GPU with mini-batches of data. We now work with data complex enough to actually warrant the use of data loaders. In particular, we don't want to load all images into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like before, the data loader is an instance of the Pytorch [`DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html?highlight=dataloader#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) which wraps a class that inherits from [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset), that we create ourselves.\n",
    "Image classification is such a common task that Pytorch provides a ready-to-use dataset class for this task, called [`ImageFolder`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html?highlight=imagefolder#imagefolder).\n",
    "Using this class however, is rather opaque so for your understanding we will show you how to construct a custom dataset class. If you know this method, you will be able to create a data loader for any dataset you may encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct a class `DogsCatsData` as a subclass of `Dataset`. \n",
    "The dataset subclass holds the actual data, or at least provides access to it.\n",
    "To make it work with the `DataLoader` class we need to implement two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getitem__(self, index)`: return the `index`'th sample, i.e. a single pair of (image, label)\n",
    "- `__len__(self)`: simply return the total number of samples $N$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are so called Python \"magic\" methods, signified by the leading and closing double underscores.\n",
    "They typically enable special syntax for a class: `__getitem__` enables indexing of a class, and `__len__` enables calling the `len` function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Consider an instance `data` of a class `MyDataset` implementing `__getitem__` and `__len__`\n",
    "data[10] # returns the item with index 10 in `data`\n",
    "len(data) # returns the length/size of `data`\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will return to why these are needed in the `DataLoader` wrapping class\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to the actual implementation: The idea is to have the dataset class only store the filenames of the images (and the corresponding label), not the images themselves. We will find and store the filenames in the constructor. The `__getitem__` method will use the index to look up the correct filename and load it into memory.\n",
    "The `__len__` method is left for you to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to use and understand code you have not written is an important ability. Below you are required to interact with the dataset class with a simple completion of the implementation and by extracting some data from the class. This is partly to ensure that you understand this specific class and partly to show you some tools for exploring new code."

Use the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html#torchvision-transforms) to view available transforms. Extra important is the `Compose` transformation, which is a meta-transformation which composes actual ones, and the `ToTensor` transformation which is the simplest way to go from image to tensor format.\n",

Shorter training cycles give you more time to experiment! **Note**: The MobileNetV2 network used later in this assignment is specialised for images that are 224x224.\n",

A particular batch with pairs of image and label is created by calling the dataset's `__getitem__` method with the indices in the batch.

Beyond this pragmatic approach, feel free to contribute to the highly contested scientific debate about the relation between batch size and generalisation.\n",

While not strictly necessary, it is an acceptable way of handling varying input dim's and it is convenient for testing.\n",

The convolutions produces feature maps which we can think of as an image with many channels, while the fully connected layer expects a row vector as input. Calculate how many output neurons the convolutions produce and use `.reshape` to make your tensor fit the fully connected layer. It is also common to see the `.view` and `.squeeze` methods to do the same thing. They basically do the same thing (apart from some differences in internal memory management) but are less transparent. *Hint within the hint:* remember that the fully connected layers expects a *batch* of 1D tensors. \n"
