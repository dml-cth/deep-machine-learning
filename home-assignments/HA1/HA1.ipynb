    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOR HA1, HA2, HA3 ONLY:** Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of POEs (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use Google Cloud's GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

Take a look at the [instructions folder](https://github.com/JulianoLagana/deep-machine-learning/blob/master/instructions/) to understand how to connect to an instance and use our tools there. You're free to use this limited resource as you see fit, but if you spend all your credits, you'll need a late day to obtain more (and you can only do this once).\n",

    "In order to make the most out of your GPU hours, first try solving the initial part of this notebook (tasks 0-3) in your own computer (these tasks can be solved on the CPU), and leave most of the available hours for solving tasks 4-5, and refining your best model further (and, if you have the spare hours, experiment a bit!).\n",

    "Once you have the expected folder structure, create two data loaders for automatically generating batches from the images in your smaller subset of data. It is here we choose how to preprocess the input data. There are multiple reasons for why we preprocess data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some transformations might be needed to actually make the data work with our network (reshaping, permuting dimensions et c.).\n",
    "- Make the training more efficient by making the input dimensions smaller, e.g. resizing, cropping.\n",
    "- Artificially expanding the training data through [data augmentation](https://cartesianfaith.com/2016/10/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-data-augmentation-for-machine-learning/)\n",
    "- We have some clever idea of how to change the data to make the training process better.\n",

    "ImageFolder(Path.cwd() / \"small_train\", transform=Compose([ToTensor]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- Take a look at [`ImageFolder`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder) and [`DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) from the pytorch docs.\n",
    "- To preprocess the data you can use the built-in pytorch [`Transforms`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html)\n",
    "- The `ImageFolder` dataset provides the data as a python image type. For easy conversion to a `torch.Tensor`, use the [`ToTensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html#torchvision.transforms.ToTensor) transformation.\n",
    "- The specified `batch_size` should be chosen so that you train fast but don't run out of memory. You need to figure this out empirically; start small and increase the batch size until you run out of memory.\n",
    "- The `DataLoader` constructor takes an optional argument `num_workers`, which defaults to `0` if not provided. Setting a higher number creates multiple threads which load batches concurrently. This can speed up training considerably.  \n",
    "- When feeding the images to your CNN, you'll probably want all of them to have the same spatial size, even though the .jpeg files differ in this. Resizing the images can be done using the previously mentioned built-in pytorch Transforms.\n",
    "- Resizing the images to a smaller size while loading them can be beneficial. The VGG network that is used later in this assignment requires that images are at least 224x224, but before that use small images to speed up training. The CNN's do surprisingly well on 64x64 or even 32x32 images. Shorter training cycles give your more time to experiment!\n",

The Kaggle CLI can be used as well. Kaggle evaluates your submission according to your log-loss score. Which score did you obtain?"
