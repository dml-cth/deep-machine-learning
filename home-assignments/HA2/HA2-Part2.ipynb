    "### Checklist for submission\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOR HA1, HA2, HA3 ONLY:** Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of POEs (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use Google Cloud's GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

The idea is to clarify the connection between these functions and an application with real data. However, note that the standard approach to maximize performance is to use a well studied transformer architecture (e.g. BERT), download pre-trained weights and then fine-tune the parameters for the considered problem. Additional resources on how one would implement a transformer in practice are appended at the end of this notebook. \n",

    "The purpose here is to build on the computer labs and to give you some inspiration for how to solve a general problem with `pytorch`. It will show you how to install additional python libraries (useful for the project) and some advice on how to construct a training/validation loop. We do not expect you to modify the code, **you don't even have to run it** if you feel that your cloud credits are starting to run low. However, you should read and understand the code; it will help you answer the questions at the end."
