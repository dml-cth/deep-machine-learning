    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to a request for resubmission if the errors are serious enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use a cloud GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

    "# 3. IMDB Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we will consider classification of IMDB reviews. For pedagogical reasons, the classification will be based upon the functions you have built above. The idea is to clarify the connection between these functions and an application with real data. However, to get better performance, we will rely on a pre-trained NLP model, namely [distill-bert](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) for extracting features and improving performance. This is a smaller version of BERT, a Transformer-based language model that is pretrained on a large corpus and useful for extracting features from text. This is similar to the transfer learning done in HA1 where we utilize powerful, general purpose models for extracting features, and finetune a smaller model for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose here is to build on the computer labs and to give you some inspiration for how to solve a general problem with `pytorch`. It will show you how to install additional python libraries (useful for the project) and some advice on how to construct a training/validation loop. We do not expect you to modify the code, **you don't even have to run the training** if you feel that your cloud credits are starting to run low. However, you should read and understand the code; it will help you answer the questions."
