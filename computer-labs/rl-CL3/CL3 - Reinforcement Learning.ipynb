We humans start solving new tasks with already a lot of accumulated knowledge about how the world works (sometimes referred to as our inductive biases), which help us quickly learn how to solve new tasks in familiar environments. For instance, it is very easy for us to understand how these types of environments function, since we have an intuitive understanding of what \"moving up\" or \"moving left\" means in a 2D grid, and we assume that this is the way the grid-world MDP will also work. This makes it much easier for us to, say, optimally guide an agent towards the terminal state. \n",

For pedagogical reasons, from this point forward we will only use the environments as defined in 1.A and 1.B for the visualizations, but do not forget the insights you've gained from this section when analyzing an agent's behavior in a new environment."

The idea is simple: in order to estimate the value function $V_\\pi$ at a certain state $s$, you compute an average of all the returns obtained at $s$ throughout your experience. Since the value of a state is the expected return, this will converge to the correct the value of $V_\\pi(s)$ as we collect more episodes that passed through the state $s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the version implemented here, we are computing *Every-visit* Monte Carlo, so that if you visit a state multiple times in an episode, the returns from all your visits will be sequentially used to update the average. Furthermore, instead of computing an actual average of all returns, we compute an exponential moving average. That is, when using a new return $G(s)$ to update our estimate of $V(s)$, we use the following update rule:\n",

    "$$ V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha \\big(G(s)-V(s)\\big)~, $$\n",
