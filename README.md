# Repository for SSY340 - Deep Machine Learning
This is the GitHub repository for the course SSY340 - Deep Machine Learning.

**DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY**\
You might be tempted to use git for syncing your work within your groups or between your local computer and the cloud. This is fine as long as you know what you are doing, but you are under no circumstances allowed to make your assignments publicly available. Be aware that GitHub forks of public repositories (such as this one) will always be public.

**Avoid Google Colab**\
There are free alternatives for running Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud with GPU support, such as Google Colab, and you might be tempted to work on your assignment there. Note however, that Google Colab destroys some under-the-hood metadata of the notebooks, which is essential to preserve for our grading tool to work properly. Still, you could work on Google Colab, as long as you copy-paste all your code and answers to a fresh notebook in the end, with its metadata being preserved, and finally re-run it as advised in the Google Cloud environment.

**Assignments may change before officially handed out**\
Even if assignment files are posted here, they are still subject to being changed before their corresponding handout date. We advise you to not start working on them before it's time.
